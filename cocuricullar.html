            <p>SARGAM is one of the biggest fest in Bangalore; held by NHCE. It is an annual state-level inter-collegiate cultural fest where students from the best colleges in Karnataka participate to unleash their talent to its true potential. The much-awaited SARGAM lasts for two days. The campus is hustling, bustling and nutsling with energy and students are seen rejoicing, taking their time off academics and yet learning something new at every event.

                Students get to learn new skills in event management and also work on their interpersonal, communication and team-building skills. This fest was started in the year 2008 and every year it gets bigger and better. The SARGAM team at NHCE specially allocates a theme for the event each year.</p>
